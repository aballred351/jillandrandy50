                        <p>One August night in a bowling alley in Des Moines, Iowa a young lad named James Stover was randomly partnered
                            with a stranger during a league night.  The two struck up a friendship and one evening after bowling, the
                            stranger, named Randy Allred, gave James a ride home.  James brought Randy in to meet his younger sister Jill,
                            and Jill and James's parents Laura and Gerald.  And as they say in Hollywood, "That's all she wrote."</p>

                                their first date at the Rubgy Club of Des Moines.  They spent hours watching the local Rubgy
                            matches and getting to know each other. At the end of the evening, Jill drove Randy home in his brand
                            new 1972 Mercury Comet after Randy became ill.  Randy said that he knew he could trust her after that.

                                <li><span>Proposal</span><br><br>Late October of 1973, Randy brought McDonald's to Jill during her 
                                    lunch break at the Walgreen's in Des Moines on East Euclid Ave.  Randy asked Jill during that lunch
                                    break to become his wife, and she happily said yes.

                                    <li><span>Wedding</span><br><br>Early evening on the day of November 23, 1973 at the RLDS church 
                                        in Urbandale, Jill and Randy said their vows in front of family and friends. Jill remembers 
                                        the day being a cool, overcast fall throughout the day, and Randy remembers it being it being 
                                        dark.

                                    green pickup truck and moved into an apartment on South 3rd Avenue in Danville.<br>They lived there for
                                a short time before they bought their forever home at 402 S. Main Street in Danville where they have 
                            lived for the next 50 years.</li>

                            <li><span>402 South Main St.</span><br><br>The house began in 1974 as a white house with 
                            wood siding, including an enclosed front porch.  Jill recalls spending hours working to 
                        remove the wallpaper from several rooms, and says that there is still a roll of the wallpaper in
                        the basement.</li>

                        from the original white to charcoal gray, to vibrant red with green and cream trim. The front porch was
                        removed and replaced with a brand new deck.</li>
